# {{ .RenderedProviderName }} Provider
The Quay provider provides resources and data sources for managing Quay organizations and repositories.

## Authentication
An authentication token can be generated in the Quay application settings page. The Quay documentation refers to it as
an `OAuth 2 Access Token`. Since there is no mechanism in Quay for creating applications outside of an organization, it
is recommended to create a separate organization and application for Terraform. Be sure to create the
`OAuth 2 Access Token` using a service account since the token will be tied to that account.
